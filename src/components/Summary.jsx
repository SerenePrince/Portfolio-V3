          About Me!
        </h1>
        <p>
          I&apos;m a software developer based in Ottawa and a current student at
          Algonquin College. I specialize in back-end development, but
          occasionally venture into in full-stack for fun. I like to code,
          create apps, and keep my wits sharp by learning new things. I love
          starting new projectsâ€”almost as much as I love leaving them
          unfinished. Right now, I&apos;m seeking opportunities in development
          or IT support, and I&apos;m open to both remote and on-site roles.
