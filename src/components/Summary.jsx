          Hey, I&apos;m Noah, a software developer and student at Algonquin
          College. I specialize in back-end development, but know my way around
          some full-stack as well. In my spare time I like to code, game, and
          play volleyball. I love starting new projectsâ€”almost as much as I love
          leaving them unfinished. I&apos;m seeking opportunities in development
          or IT support, and I&apos;m open to both remote and on-site roles.
